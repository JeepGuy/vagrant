#Install Vagrant on Linux on CentOs7

https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/


# yum -y install gcc dkms make qt libgomp patch 
# yum -y install kernel-headers kernel-devel binutils glibc-headers glibc-devel font-forge

Next add VirtualBox repository.

# cd /etc/yum.repo.d/
# wget http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/rpm/rhel/virtualbox.repo

Now install and build kernel module.

# yum install -y VirtualBox-5.1
# /sbin/rcvboxdrv setup

 Installing Vagrant on CentOS 7

download and install latest version of Vagrant (i.e 1.9.6 at the time of writing) using yum command.

----------- For 64-bit machine -----------
# yum -y install https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.9.6/vagrant_1.9.6_x86_64.rpm

----------- For 32-bit machine ----------- 
# yum -y install https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.9.6/vagrant_1.9.6_i686.rpm

Create a directory where you will be going to install your favorite Linux distribution or operating system.

# mkdir ~/vagrant-home 
# cd ~/vagrant-home 

Install your favorite distro or operating system.

----------- Installing Ubuntu -----------
# vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64

----------- Installing CentOS -----------
# vagrant init centos/7

A file called Vagrantfile will be created in your current directory. This file contains configuration settings for your virtual machines.

Boot up your Ubuntu server.

# vagrant up

Wait for the download to finish. It doesn’t really take much time. Your internet speed also count.

Step 3: Manage Vagrant Boxes with Virtualbox

Launch Virtualbox to see a pre-built 64-bit Ubuntu virtual machine loaded into virtualbox with configuration defined in Vagrantfile. This is just like any other VM: No difference.

If you want to setup another box (say CentOS7), modify your Vagrantfile file in your current directory (if that is where your Vagrantfile is located) with your favorite editor. I use vi editor for my work. Immediately below line 15, type:

config.vm.box = “centos/7”

You can also setup the IP address as well as hostnames for the yet-to-be downloaded box within the Vagrantfile. You can do this for as many boxes that you want to provision as possible.

To set up static IP address, uncomment line 35 and change the IP address to your choice.

config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

After you are done with this modification, enter the command below to up the machine.

# vagrant up

Managing this virtual server is extremely easy.

# vagrant halt     [shutdown server]
# vagrant up       [start server]
# vagrant destroy  [delete server]
